## Details:

<details><summary>Hello, during my time at Cakrawala this repository was the one i made for the assignments that Mr. Rony gave me.</summary><p>

## Details on the first Assignment: (Due: 08 March, 2025)

### All is to write 5 distinc codes, seen in this section: (Javascript)
#### Write a code to find the area of a rectangle:
- input: Length = 5 , Width = 3
- output: Area = 15
###### My work:
- so for my work i created my own width being 10 while length is 20, which resulted in the area being 200.
#### Find the Diameter, Circumfrence, and Area of a circle:
- input: Radius = 5
- output: Diameter = 10 , Circumference = 31.4159 , Area = 78.539
###### My work:
- During my work i decided instead of multiplying radius by itself, i instead use exponents. Instead of creating a variable that represents Pi, i imported a math related file to import Pi automatically.
#### Find the angles of a triangle if two were given:
- input: a = 80 , b = 65
- output: 35
###### My work:
- during this work i used parenthese
#### Get the difference in time between two interval of dates in the form of days: (DD/MM/YYYY)
- input: date1 = 01-01-2025 , date2 = 03-01-2025
- output: 2
###### My work:
- during this work i had to learn all sorts of new methods in relation to date, which i found that in Javascript one can only use (MM/DD/YYYY) with the methods used. also note 3600 seconds was two 60 seconds combined for simplification purposes.
#### Only recognizes the initials within a string:
- input: John Doe
- output: JD
###### My work:
- i had to learn functions, then string, then subtracting those strings, then a bit of if without else, returning value.
