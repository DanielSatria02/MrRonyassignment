### All is to write 5 distinc codes, seen in this section: (Javascript)
#### Write a code to find the area of a rectangle:
- input: Length = 5 , Width = 3
- output: Area = 15
###### My work:
- so for my work i used instead width being 10 while length is 20, which resulted in the area being 200.
#### Find the Diameter, Circumfrence, and Area of a circle:
- input: Radius = 5
- output: Diameter = 10 , Circumfrence = 31.4159 , Area = 78.539
###### My work:
- During my work i idecided instead of multiplying radius by itself, i instead use exponents. Instead of creating a variable that represents Pi, i imported a math related file to import Pi automatically.
#### Find the angles of a triangle if two were given:
- input: a = 80 , b = 65
- output: 35
#### Get the difference in time between two interval of dates in the form of days: (DD/MM/YYYY)
- input: date1 = 01-01-2025 , date2 = 03-01-2025
